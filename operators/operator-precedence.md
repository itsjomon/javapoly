# Operator Precedence and Associativity in Java

Operator precedence determines the order in which operators in an expression are evaluated.

### Example
```java
int x = 3 * 4 - 1;
```

In the above example, the value of `x` will be **`11`**, not `9`. This happens because the precedence of the multiplication operator (`*`) is higher than the subtraction operator (`-`). Therefore, the expression is evaluated as `(3 * 4) - 1` and not `3 * (4 - 1)`.

## Operator Precedence & Associativity Table

When an expression has two operators with the same precedence, the expression is evaluated according to its **associativity** (either left-to-right or right-to-left).
