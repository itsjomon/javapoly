/*
Type Promotion in Expressions:
1. Java automatically promotes each byte, short, or char operand to int when evaluating an expression.
2. If one operand is long, float, or double the whole expression is promoted to long, float, or double respectively.

Example:
byte b = 5;
b = b*2; // This will cause an error because b*2 is promoted to int, and you cannot assign an int to a byte without casting. To fix this, you can cast the result back to byte:

byte b = 5;
b = (byte) (b*2); // This will work because we are explicitly casting the result back to byte.
