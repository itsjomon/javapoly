/*
A variable is a container that holds a value. It has a name and a type. The type of a variable determines what kind of data it can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or strings.
In Java, you must declare a variable before you can use it. The declaration includes the type of the variable and its name. You can also assign a value to the variable at the time of declaration or later in the code.
A literal is a fixed value that is directly written in the code, such as 10, 5, or "Jomon". A variable is a named container that can hold a value, and an identifier is the name given to a variable, method, class, or other entity in Java.
For example: in the expression 2*(a + b), 2 is a literal, while a and b are variables (identifiers).
